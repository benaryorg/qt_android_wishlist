# Wishlist

This is an application meant to manage a wishlist, i.e. for Christmas or your
birthday.
It is written in QML and meant to be run on mobile devices but is also usable
as a desktop application.

Please be aware that this was written within a few hours, after it was given as
an assignment, part of an exam.
The original assignment stated that it should be written in Java.
I don't like Java.

# Compilation

If you have qt-creator and a working Qt environment for building Android
applications, just open the project file and compile for your targets.
